Trying to set up a 3D quasidynamic rupture model recently.
I've encountered several issues:
-- see previous post on the details of doing RSF
-- previous post on regularized RSF
-- continuity of the slip field was necessary. otherwise, infinite stresses...
-- pretty sure the BCs are a bit weird and something is wrong there. 
-- having a mix of vel strengthening and vel weakening changes the behavior a lot
-- making gifs with matplotlib
