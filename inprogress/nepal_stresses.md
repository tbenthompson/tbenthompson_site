I'm working to answer this question.

The current idea is to use an elastic wedge model similar to Yin 1993 or Hu and Wang 2006. In contrast, my models are numerical boundary element models instead of analytical models. That means that I can use realistic fault geometries and surface topography. In particular, I can include internal faults.

So how can this be used to infer a realistic stress state? Two steps:
1) include all faults in the Himalayan wedge, allowing them to slip. Determine the range of tectonic driving forces and fault friction coefficients that cause these faults to slip in the correct direction (determined by geological fields analysis).
2) take those same driving forces and friction coefficients, remove the interior faults (in other words, lock them) and ask what the stresses are in the vicinity of the Gorkha Earthquake.

The key insight is that geological observations like fault slip rate limit the set of acceptable stress fields.

More details soon!
