title: Why work on earthquake prediction?
---

I want to work on earthquake prediction. 

Many academics are comfortable working towards the pure pursuit of knowledge. I'm not like that. I want to either have a direct impact on people through my work or make [large amounts of money and donate that to effective causes](https://80000hours.org/). Since, I'm working on a PhD in earthquake science, I frequently wonder whether studying earthquakes is a valuable pursuit. What is the practical impact of working on earthquakes? As a point of comparison, Givewell estimates that donating to provide malaria bed nets through the Against Malaria Foundation can [save a life for approximately $3000](http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/amf#Costperlifesaved). So, if I'm forsaking $100,000 of income every year by working on earthquake science rather than something more lucrative, then I intend to hold myself to the bar of aiming to prevent 33 deaths per year through earthquake research. 

Much of the immediate potential for reducing the potential for deadly earthquake is through policy - seismic retrofitting of older buildings, high-quality and enforced building standards, earthquake preparedness. First world earthquake fatality rates are dramatically lower than third-world fatality rates, probably for these reasons. But, the question at hand is whether earthquake *science* has substantial direct impact. I see three ways in which it can.

1. Improved ground motion prediction. The shaking that results from an earthquake is a complex function of the slip during the earthquake (source effects), the propagation of waves through the earth to the building in question (path effects), and site effects that may increase shaking amplitude (e.g. being at the top of a hill). The path and site effects can vary a lot, both with the location of a building and with the location of the earthquake. This means that estimating the maximum magnitude of earthquakes in a region is only part of the puzzle. Physical models of the earth allow computing the shaking induced at a particular location due to an earthquake on a particular fault. Alternately, we can empirically determine the path and site effects by observing the passage of seismic waves from smaller earthquakes or from [seismic noise](link marine denolle). There appears to be substantial room for improvement in this area.
2. Earthquake early warning. Earthquake ruptures and the damaging surface waves that are produced travel at ~3 km/sec, whereas telecomunnications travel at 300,000 km/sec. So, if we can detect that a large earthquake has started, then major cities can be given anywhere from a few seconds to a minute of warning. However, determining whether an earthquake that has just started is going to be large and damaging or fizzle out is a tough problem. 
3. Earthquake prediction. Predicting the precise timing and magnitude of earthquakes is a holy grail for earthquake science. But, it's only the ideal along a spectrum of tasks. At the easy end of the spectrum is earthquake forecasting. We've gotten pretty good at saying things like "There's a 40 percent chance of a magnitude 7 or greater earthquake is Southern California over the next 50 years" (not real numbers). This kind of statement can be made on the basis  But, being more precise than that requires an underst

For the first three years of my PhD, I've been working on 
I've been working indirectly on the earthquake prediction problem. I could switch subfields and get involved in improving ground motion prediction or earthquake early warning, but I see these as potentially saturated areas (THINK ABOUT THIS). 

So, is short-term earthquake prediction possible? 

This is a high risk, high reward area to work in. It seems that there is a substantial.

Based on the self-similarity of earthquakes, NAME has argued that they're inherently unpredictable. 

Maybe it's possible to identify the characteristics of a world in which. 

[1] Earthquakes also cause massive economic damage. I'm not quite sure how to include that in a calculus like this. The 2011 Japan/Tohoku-Oki Earthquake killed ~16,000 and cost [upwards of $300 billion](http://www.reuters.com/article/japan-economy-idUSL3E7FC09220110412). United States federal government departments use numbers somewhere between [\\$7 million and \\$10 million](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_of_life) as the statistical cost of a life. Assuming that reconstruction money would be spent somewhere else if the earthquake hadn't happened, then that implies the equivalent of another ~50,000 lives lost in the event.
