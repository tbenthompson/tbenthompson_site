### Interaction of Middle-crustal Viscoplasticity and Earthquake Rupture
Observational methods have difficulty resolving the deeper parts of a fault zone.  Despite its importance for seismic hazard estimates, we donâ€™t have good observational constraints on the maximum depth penetration of an earthquake rupture. On the other hand, laboratory studies are able to accurately quantify the basic physical processes involved in the deep parts of the seismogenic zone. I am taking these descriptions of middle crustal rheology and incorporating them into physical models of the earthquake cycle. I am working to resolve both the earthquake rupture and interseismic creep, with the goal of understanding how fault processes change at depth.
What I am currently working on:

A software package to solve the elastic wave equations using local time stepping and adaptive mesh refinement in an ADER finite volume framework. This will allow me to efficiently resolve near-fault physics.
Numerical methods to model interseismic creep and temperature evolution assuming arbitrary crustal rheologies.
