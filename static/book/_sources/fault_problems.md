# Problems in earthquake science

The world of geophysics and earthquake science has a huge range of modeling problems. The spatial scales span from the nano/micro scale behavior of rock mechanics and friction to the thousands of kilometers on the global scale. The temporal scales span from micro or millisecond behavior inside a fault zone to seconds/minutes during an earthquake to hundreds of years during the interseismic period all the way to millions of years for plate tectonics motions. Physics varies wildly: elastic waves, friction, pore-fluid flow, plastic failure, viscous flow.

Seismic inversion:
- the main behavior of interest are elastic waves. These are essentially sound waves traveling through a solid.
- the sources of these waves are either from humans
- the stresses involved are quite small, except very close to the wave source.
- the time scales are generally a few milliseconds up to a few minutes.

Earthquake cycle simulation:
- the two core behaviors of interest are
