See <a href="/resume.pdf">my resume</a> for some info on what I do at <a href="https://quantco.com/">QuantCo.</a>

I'm particularly excited about being part of the team that released the first two open source packages from QuantCo. We built [glum](https://github.com/Quantco/glum/) as the generalized linear modeling package that we had all wished existed. And that project led to [tabmat](https://github.com/Quantco/tabmat/) as a backend for efficiently working with tabular matrix data containing a mix of dense, sparse and categorical subcomponents.
