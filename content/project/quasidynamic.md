Earthquake modelling normally involves a planar fault in an elastic half or full space. Over the past couple years, I have looked at what happens to static earthquake models when we add fault geometry, surface topography and Earth curvature. There are some large and interesting effects. I am now looking into the influence of these geometric effects on quasidynamic and dynamic earthquake rupture models. A lot of research has been directed towards to complex, nonlinear effects of rheology and friction laws in rupture modeling. I suspect that geometric effects will also have a strong and nonlinear influence on rupture models.
