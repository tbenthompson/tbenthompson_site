For an undergraduate research project, I worked with [Alejandra](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4uDVRD0AAAAJ&hl=en) to automate a procedure to quantify finite strain on a microscale. On a certain surface, a sample is etched (like a microprocessor) with spaced dots. Then, on a microscope photograph, the dot positions are recorded before and after deformation. However, tracking hundreds of thousands of these dots by hand is impossible. So, I worked on an algorithm to determine the deformation function between the initial and final images by tracking the dot positions. In computer vision, this is called optical flow and is often formulated as a regularized least squares problem.
