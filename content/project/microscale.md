For an undergraduate research project, I worked with [Alejandra](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4uDVRD0AAAAJ&hl=en) to automate a procedure to quantify finite strain on a microscale. On a certain surface, a sample is etched (like a microprocessor) with spaced dots. Then, on a microscope photograph, the dot positions are recorded before and after deformation. However, tracking hundreds of thousands of these dots by hand is impossible. So, I worked on an algorithm to determine the deformation function between the initial and final images by tracking the dot positions.
