[A recent paper outlining our Galerkin BEM approach.](https://eartharxiv.org/xzhuk/)

My tectonic and earthquake cycle research is supported by development of elastic boundary element software. This has required investigations into the best approaches for a wide range of computational and mathematical tasks: singular integration of Green's functions, approximation of farfield Green's function interactions with the fast multipole method, flexible treatment of equality and inequality constraints, and a big dose of computational geometry. These are a just a few of the components of this effort. This new software will be able to model arbitrary geometries including surface topography, complex data-derived fault geometries, and material boundaries. Models with millions of elements will be possible in two or three dimensions. Exciting!
