* fast turnaround -- almost all code I write should be posted to my website within a week
* how to engage academics without writing academic papers? email subscribe?
* Is it possible to work very closely with people? I like to have regularly doses of the kind of collaboration where I'm working on the same problem as someone else and we're talking multiple times in a day. In my past experience, this was extremely common in software engineering positions and very commmon in academia. Do other people want this? Want to work together with me? Let me know!
* I won't be bothered if you leave me off your author list. If I contribute to your project and you don't feel like offering me authorship, I don't mind. This will probably have a direct negative impact on my career, but I'm suspicious that, given my goals, it will have a larger indirect positive impact. Also, publishing is no fun, let's just write!
* Let me know if you have interesting problems that you want to on. I'm happy to say no if I'm not interested or I don't have time. Funding will help convince me, but is not a panacea if I think you have the wrong plan.
* how to maintain collaborations with people on the cutting edge of software engineering? My job has been good for this, but I see a lot of academics developing stale skillsets.



One thing that I think I would have a big advantage in as a not-an-academic working on scientific research is that I'd be able to focus on and write more about this "softer stuff" that people don't normally write down. That may not help me personally in a traditionally definable way, but it would probably help "the field".

Unrelatedly, I find it super depressing that paper reviews are not made public. People put a lot of effort into them and then they just get thrown in the trash after the feedback is incorporated into the paper! Once Eileen (other Brendan group grad student) explained to me that part of learning to give a good research talk is to learn to leave out the scaffolding and focus on the results. I think it's really depressing that people think that way. The process may be more important than the result and lots of people totally ignore that part in their communication with anyone beyond their close friends and collaborators.
