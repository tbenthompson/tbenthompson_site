1. Building tools 
1. I've done some cursory investigation of fusion research as a potential field to get involved in. I've gotten mixed reviews from people working in the field. One researcher felt that very little progress is being made while another said almost the exact opposite. 


Maybe this situation is a natural result of doing a deep search for "what shoudl I work on?" Given a sufficient level of talent, there are lots of options and they all seem pretty. I think this situation may be exacerbated by my effort to start some kind of technical research consulting concept/team. I don't think I'm well suited to the idea. I really like the type of work that it implies for me: help people out on their tricky computational or software problems. But I don't like the part where I stop working on the project after that! And the part where I'm not investing and building a concrete thing. Consulting on other people's research projects implies that you don't truly believe in anything because otherwise you'd work on your own projects!

An alternative approach here is to invest in more than a couple things with continual check ins to see if there's a point in time when I should collapse the effort function to a single project. At the moment, there's not a clear one thing that is the absolute obvious thing to work on.
