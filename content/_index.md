# About me 
I am a geoscientist, computational mathematician and software developer. In these roles, I study active tectonics and the earthquake cycle. My recent research estimates the tectonic driving forces and frictional fault strengths in the Himalayas and Tibet using innovative boundary element methods.

I am a graduate student in the Harvard Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences where I am advised by Prof. Brendan Meade.
