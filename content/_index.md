Hi! Some topics that excite me and I write about here: software dev, computational math, high performance computing, machine learning, integral equations, earthquake science. 

Other things that excite me that I don't write about here: growing plants, running, mountains, my dog, the time I jacked up my house by a quarter inch. 

You can reach me by email at [t.ben.thompson@gmail.com](mailto:t.ben.thompson@gmail.com)

I'm excited to talk to you about all sorts of stuff! Also let me know if you want to work together:

* I'm always [looking for new collaborators](/post/maintaining_momentum) on open source software, machine learning, numerical methods for PDEs, earthquake science and beyond. 
* I work at a machine learning and data science startup called [QuantCo](https://quantco.com/). We are almost always hiring talented people.
