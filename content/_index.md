I am a geoscientist, software developer, and computational mathematician. My recent research applies new, efficient and powerful boundary element methods to active tectonics and earthquake cycle problems. 

I am a graduate student in the Harvard Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences where I am advised by Prof. Brendan Meade. 

I also really like to run and ski a long ways in the mountains.
