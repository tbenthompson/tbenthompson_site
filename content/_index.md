Hi, my name is Ben Thompson.

I'm currently working on [AI interpretability at Anthropic.](https://transformer-circuits.pub) Previously, I was a co-founder of [Confirm Labs](https://www.confirmlabs.org) working on AI adversarial robustness and interpretability.

I'm excited to talk to you about all sorts of stuff. And let me know if [you want to work together](/whatido).

A big list of topics that excite me and I write about here: artificial intelligence, machine learning, software engineering, computational math, high performance computing, integral equations, earthquake science, earthquake prevention, adaptive experimentation, the structure of science, science policy, and many more.

Other things that excite me that I don't write about here: growing plants, running, mountains, my dog, the time I jacked up my house by a quarter inch.
