Hi! A big list of topics that excite me and I write about here: software dev, computational math, high performance computing, machine learning, integral equations, earthquake science, earthquake prevention, adaptive experimentation, the structure of science, science policy, and many more.

Other things that excite me that I don't write about here: growing plants, running, mountains, my dogs, the time I jacked up my house by a quarter inch. 

You can reach me by email at [t.ben.thompson@gmail.com](mailto:t.ben.thompson@gmail.com)

I'm excited to talk to you about all sorts of stuff. Also let me know if [you want to work together](/whatido).

I've recently co-founded [Confirm Solutions](https://www.confirmsol.org).
