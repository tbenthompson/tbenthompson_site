    "I've recently learned about using file backed shared memory with mmap to do efficient interprocess communication. At the most basic level, you share data between two processes by writing that data to a file. The file can be made to look a lot like a normal region of memory using `mmap`, a system call, and can be shared between multiple processes by giving `mmap` the `MAP_SHARED` flag. There's a downside though, in that the data has to synced to the hard drive continuously. So, instead of sharing a file that is written to disk, I discovered that you can share a file on a RAM disk -- just a filesystem that is backed by RAM. On Linux, a large `tmpfs` RAM disk filesystem is often mounted by default at `/dev/shm`. \n",
